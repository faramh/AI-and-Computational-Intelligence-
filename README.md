# AI-and-Computational-Intelligence-
Here is My projects of the course "AI and Computational Intelligence" which is presented by Dr. Sepideh Hajipour in EE department at Sharif University of Technology

In this project we aim to predict the positive and negative feeling and this 2 labels form our 2 classes. We have a Dataset of 10 people in the environment of VR (Virtual Reality) and by different stimuli we make positive and negative feeling for them. We have totally 709 Experiments to train our model. 550 of the experiments are used for training model so they have labels 1 and -1 based on the type of feeling and other 159 data are without any label and we should do the prediction. In this report first we describe our method to build this model and after that we check the accuracy of this model to see how well it can do the predictions.
